# BAP
App, which helps you to place signboards on building, according to Lviv's laws.

How it works?

1. Upload your image (photo of building's front)
2. Press "press signs", it will place signs where it should be
3. Move, resize each signboard, even edit it(change font, color, background)
4. Add markup to image to determine size
5. Save results as 1) image with new signboards 2) plan with each signboard (bounds and whole info)
6. Enjoy =)
